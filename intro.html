    <p><b>Identity V</b> (or IDV for short) is an asymmetrical horror game developed by Netease where you have 4 survivors and one hunter. If you've played or heard of Dead By Daylight, it's basically that, but more silly in apperance and if everyone were instead dolls. </p>

    <p>As a survivor, you try to complete 5 ciphers and open the exit gates to escape, ideally with as much of your team alive as possible.</p>
    <p>The hunter is the guy that kills you.</p>
    <p>Simple enough, right?</p>
    <h2>RIGHT.</h2>
