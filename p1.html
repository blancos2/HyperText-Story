    <h1>THE BEGINNING OF MY GRIEVANCES</h1>
    <p>Naturally, when playing with a bunch of strangers, you are relying on them. Trusting them, to know how to play the game. Of course. This is an optimistic. Naive hope.</p>
    <p>Playing in ranked has taught me that some people refuse to read. Refuse to cooperate. Out of malice? Ignorance? Boredom? You will think to yourself- this is what my team needs right now, and then turn around and see that one of your teammates has heard your prayers and decided to run directly at the hunter, <b>ZERO GAME PLAN, ZERO RESOURCES, ZERO KITING SPOTS</b> so as to speed up their untimely demise. Or perhaps they decided that overcommitting to one singular thing would surely allow them to win big.<br> Or maybe they thought that their life was more valuable than everyone else and decided to lead the hunter to you in the middle of you trying to get a simple heal off.</p>

    <p>Not to generalize all players that main a certain character, but I must say this:</p>
    <h2>PERFUMER MAINS STAY OUT OF MY MATCHES.</h2>
    <p>As a decoder main, I do my job best when my team can prolong the speed at which they die, and or keep the hunter away from me as long as possible so I can do my thing, uninterrupted.</p>
    <p>Now imagine you're 12 seconds into a match, and then hear the dreadful bells that doth toll when someone gets downed. Of course, given that I tend to stay AWAY from whatever is going on with the hunter, but I can only guess as to what transpired to result in the world's shortest kite.</p>
    <p>Of course, it only gets worse when someone is put in the dreaded basement.</p>
